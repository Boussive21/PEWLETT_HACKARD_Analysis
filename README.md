# PEWLETT_HACKARD_Analysis
#Purpose of project
We creating a data base Pewlette Hackard that gathering and sorting employee info and determining which employees are retiring and can qualify for to participate for the Pewlette Hackard mentorship program. The employees we will be filtering is employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955.  In deliverable 1 we created a query that got the empo_no, first_name, last_name, from the employee tables. We then would title, from_date, and to_date from the titles table in doing this we would join the two tables. After completing this we created a new table called unique titles and removed all duplicates. Finally we used a Distinct on function then ordered the unique titles by the number of counts. The second query we created a new table called mentor eligibility that retrieved employees and dept_emp table, filtered data on current employees born in 1965 then ordered the table by emp_no. 
# Results 
•	Retiring titles mirrors unique titles and many of the workers that are on unique titles are on retiring titles. 
•	The count on retirement titles shows a majority that we are filtering employees have senior in their titles. 
•	A majority that qualifies for mentorship table are senior level staff. 
•	Retirement titles show that a majority of the employees hired are employees who stay on staff for a long time
# Conclusions 
We are seeing that a majority of employees are within retirement age maybe over 60 percent of the workforce will likely need their position filled with in the next 5 years. There maybe a lack of skilled workers in the current force so finding candidates who can serve a mentors will be in the best interest of the company. To maintain better business practice as well as maintaining company tradition. Luckily There are enough people that qualify to mentors the future employees or current employees.
